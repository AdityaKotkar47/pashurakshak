## About PashuRakshak

PashuRakshak is a comprehensive animal rescue management platform that connects animal lovers, NGOs, and volunteers to streamline the entire rescue process. The name "PashuRakshak" combines "Pashu" (animal) and "Rakshak" (protector) in Hindi, embodying our mission to protect and care for animals in distress.

2. **Assignment**: The request is routed to nearby NGOs who can accept the mission
3. **Coordination**: The NGO assigns a volunteer team to handle the rescue
4. **Execution**: Volunteers follow a structured process, updating status at each step
5. **Completion**: The animal is rescued, treated, and the operation is documented
6. **Follow-up**: The requester receives updates throughout the process

## Our Vision

PashuRakshak aims to become the standard platform for animal rescue operations across India, creating a network where no animal in distress goes unnoticed or unhelped. By combining technology with compassion, we're building a more humane world for all creatures.
